                <p>In a deck of cards, I'm a face that's rare, With a symbol that's out of this world and rare. Some may say I'm lucky, ubt that's not my goal, For my power is great, and my influence whole. I'm known by a name that's both simple and hold, And my reputation is worth much moe than gold. Though my siblings may share my suit and my hue, None of them can do what I'm able to do. <br>What am I?<br>(Answer with all lowercase charaters.)</p>
