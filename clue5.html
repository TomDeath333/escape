                <p>I'm a subject that's feared by many, both young and old, But to others, I'm a treasure, worth more than gold. I deal in numbers, in shapes, and in space, And my beauty and elegance are hard to replace. I require logic, patience, and thought, And some may find me a challenge, a lot. I' found in equations, in graphs, and in charts, And I'm used to solve problems, both simple and hard. It's a subject that's vast, and full of wonder, And to some, it's like music, a joy to ponder. It's a discipline that's powerful, and never mundane, And to thoses who embrace it, it's more than just a game.<br>What am I?<br>(Answer in lowercase charaters)</p>
