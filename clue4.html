                <p>I am a game played by many, both young and old, A classic pastime, never growing cold. I require no board, no ball, nor stick, Just quick reflexes and a mind that's quick .Players run, they dodge, they hid and seek, Trying to avoid being tagged, so meek. They race around, their hearts pounding fast, As they try to evade, until that last. It's a game of speed, cunning, and fun, Played in the park, the playground, or in the sun. It's loved by all ,and played with glee, a game of youth, forever carefree <br>What am I?<br>(Answer in lowercased charaters)</p>
