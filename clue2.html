                <p>I'm a performer, but not like the rest, For I can do things that are truly the best. I can make things appear and disappear, And leave my audience gasping, full of cheer. I wield a wand, and wear a cape, And my skills are honed until they're great. I can make a rabbit appear from a hat, Or levitate objects with a flick and a pat. My tricks are illusions, that's for sure, But the joy they bring is hard to ignore. From cards to coins to sleight of hand, My magic knows no bounds or lands. <br> What am I?(answer with lowercase charaters)</p>
