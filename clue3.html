                <p>I'm a game that's played by many, both young and old, With swords and bows and blocks of gold. Players rush to defend their bed, Ad try to eliminate the other team instead. Bridges are built, and walls are fortfied, As players fight for glory, with all their might. Diamonds are minded, and resources gathered, As players strive to stay alive and unscathed. It's a game of strategy, teamwork, and skill, Where one mistake can lead to a quick kill. It's loved by many, and played for hours, As players build their empires and towers.<br>What am I?<br>(Answer with lowercased charaters)</p>
